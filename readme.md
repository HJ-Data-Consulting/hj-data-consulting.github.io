# HJ Consulting - Elite Cloud Architecture

This repository contains the source code for Herman Justino's professional practice, focused on elite cloud architecture and reliability engineering. 

Everything here follows the philosophical foundations laid out in our [internal context](https://github.com/HJ-Data-Consulting/core-ops): building systems with judgment, restraint, and architectural taste.

## Practice Areas

- **Elite Cloud Architecture** - Decisions that scale socially and technically. Designing for failure, cost, and human operators.
- **Cloud Reliability Engineering** - Implementing systems that fail honestly. SRE principles applied to growth-stage startups.
- **Data Infrastructure at Scale** - Sound abstractions for complex data lifecycles. Principled tradeoffs for GCP-native environments.
- **The Decision Feed** - A public, compounding proof of architectural taste. Distilling raw engineering into defensible artifacts.

## Technical Foundation

- **Platform:** Google Cloud Program (Founder partner)
- **Stack:** Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind (Modernizing towards)
- **Legacy:** This portfolio is built with Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS to demonstrate simplicity and control.

## Deployment

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages and served at [hjdconsulting.ca](https://hjdconsulting.ca).
